# Labeler

A web app which lets you categorize text.

## How to use

1. Write or paste categories into the categories box, one per line.
2. Write or paste words into the words box, one per line.
3. Start clicking categories and the json map will fill up!

The word categories are output to the Mapping box as JSON. You can edit that directly to update the categories. For example, you can delete a category, rename a category or word, or even copy/paste results to/from somewhere else.

**Note**: if you rename a category or word in the categories/words boxes, it will *clear* the category or remove the word from its category.
