# Labeller

A little react app which lets you put strings in categories.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to use

    $ npm start

1. Write or paste categories into the categories box
2. Write or paste words into the words box
3. Start clicking categories and the json map will fill up!

The word categories are encoded directly in the Mapping box as JSON, which is the main output of this tool. You can edit that directly to update the categories. For example, here you can delete a category, rename a category or word, or even copy/paste results to/from somewhere else.

**Note**: if you rename a category or word in the categories/words boxes, it will *clear* the category or remove the word from its category.
